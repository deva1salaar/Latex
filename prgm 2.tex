In today’s world, news is shared quickly through social media, but not all of it is true. Fake news is a big problem—it can confuse people, cause panic, and even create serious issues in society. One of the hardest parts is finding out where the fake news came from and who is responsible for it.\\

Our project aims to solve this by creating a news-sharing platform that uses blockchain technology. With blockchain, every piece of news and user action is recorded in a secure, unchangeable system. This means the origin of the news can be tracked, and the information stays safe from being changed or hacked.\\

The platform will be easy to use. People can read news, share their own content, and even rate how real or fake a news story seems. This helps others decide what to trust. Our goal is to create a place where only reliable and honest news can survive.\\
