\section{What is LaTeX?}

LaTeX is a powerful system for creating high-quality typeset documents. LaTeX doesn't use a WYSIWYG approach. Instead, you write your document using plain text interspersed with formatting commands.



\section{Why use LaTeX?}

LaTeX is ideal for producing scientific and mathematical documents due to its excellent handling of formulas and bibliographies. It also ensures consistent formatting across documents, making it a favorite for academic writing.
